# Project Repository Overview
**1) ACF and PACF Understanding**
Description: This notebook explores the concepts of Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) in time series analysis. It likely includes visualizations and explanations of how ACF and PACF are used to identify patterns and relationships in time series data.

**2) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test**
Description: This notebook demonstrates the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test, which is a statistical test used to determine whether a unit root is present in time series data. It helps in assessing the stationarity of a time series.

**3) AR Model**
Description: This notebook implements an Autoregressive (AR) model, a type of time series model where the current value of a variable is regressed on its own past values. It's useful for forecasting based on the linear relationship between the variable and its lagged values.

**4) MA Model**
Description: This notebook implements a Moving Average (MA) model, which is another type of time series model where the current value of a variable is a linear combination of past prediction errors. It's useful for capturing short-term trends and noise in the data.

**5) ARMA Model**
Description: This notebook implements an Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, which combines both the AR and MA models into a single framework. It's useful for capturing both short-term trends and long-term dependencies in the data.

**6) ARIMA Model**
Description: This notebook implements an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which extends the ARMA model by including differencing to make the time series stationary. It's useful for non-stationary data.

**7) Seasonal ARIMA Model**
Description: This notebook implements a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, which extends the ARIMA model to handle seasonality in the data. It's useful for time series data with periodic patterns.
File: 7) SARIMA_Model.ipynb

**8) Vector Autoregression Model**
Description: This notebook implements a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, a multivariate time series model where each variable is modeled as a linear combination of its lagged values and the lagged values of other variables. It's useful for analyzing and forecasting multiple time series simultaneously.

**9) Indian Stock Forecasting with LSTMs**
Description: This notebook utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for forecasting Indian stock market data. LSTMs are powerful models for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
